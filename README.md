# When Riders Meet Drivers (⚠️ WIP)
__*Seasonal patterns as a lever to GROW REVENUE in the ride-hailing business*__

This repository presents how sharing predictability with partners can convert into revenue in the ride-hailing business. The predictability here is derived from seasonal patterns at the matching and contrasting points in the daily and weekly seasonality of the different sides of a ride-hailing marketplace.  

A summary of results is presented below.  
The full analysis (business question, data collection & cleaning, analysis & synthesis) is available **[here](data-analysis.md)**.  
The SQL code ran in the study is available [here](when-riders-meet-drivers.sql), and on [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=547152705700:2c2438efe4534dfab31839bfa6bdb742).  

Tags: `product-analytics`, `sql`, `bigquery`.

<!-- Intro -->

**What is the mission of a marketplace?**  
A marketplace dedicates to making supply meet demand. This mission usually comes with some added requirements, of lesser or greater importance depending on the market that it serves, which may require or value safety, timeliness, accuracy, quality.  

This repository is part of a study on **ride-hailing** marketplaces. In that field of business, **timeliness** is key. Focusing on the issue, **a data visualization prototype is presented here**, designed to bring to light the points of correspondence and contrast in the daily and weekly schedules of the different sides of a ride-hailing app.  

Specifically, the search is for insights on the following questions:  

> <i> « Are there any significant differences between preferred drivers' schedules and passengers' needs? » </i>  
> <i> « If so, when do the most critical disparities occur? » </i> 

Given that ride-hailing is a business run by private companies that keep such data confidential, the supply-demand dynamics of a city-hall regulated taxi market is taken as an approximation, for which data is available from Google BigQuery public datasets.
