<!-- Intro -->

**What does a marketplace do?**  
A marketplace dedicates to making supply meet demand. Depending on the market that it serves, some requirements may be present, with lesser or greater importance, such as safety, timeliness, accuracy, quality.  

This repository is part of a study on **ride-hailing** marketplaces. In this business field, **timeliness** is key. Focusing on the issue, **a framework is presented here**, designed to bring an understanding of the points of correspondence and contrast in the daily and weekly schedules of the different sides of a ride-hailing app.  

Specifically, the search is for insights on the following questions:  

> <i> Â« Are there any significant differences between preferred drivers' schedules and passengers' needs? Â» </i>  
> <i> Â« If so, when do the most critical disparities occur? Â» </i> 

Given that ride-hailing is a business run by private companies that keep such data confidential, the supply-demand dynamics of a city-hall regulated taxi market is taken as an approximation, for which data is available from Google BigQuery public datasets.

Tags: `product-analytics`, `sql`, `bigquery`.
