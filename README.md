Ride-hailing seasonality of supply vs seasonality of demand.
___

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<!-- Intro -->

This repository is part of a study in understanding the matching and contrasting points in the daily and weekly seasonality of the different sides of a ride-hailing marketplace. Specifically, the search is for insight into the following questions:

> <i> Â« Are there any significant differences between favorite drivers' schedules and passengers' needs? Â» </i>  
> <i> Â« If so, when do the most critical imbalances occur? Â» </i> 

Since ride-hailing is a business run by private companies that keep such data confidential, the supply-demand dynamics is taken as ann approximation, for which data is available from BigQuery's public datasets.

Tags: `product-analytics`, `sql`, `bigquery`.
